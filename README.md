# Viterbi Decoder #

[Viterbi decoder][1] is an optimal decoder for convolution codes in the
maximum-likelihood sense for AWGN case.

This is a very small C++ library (just two files) implementing the decoder.

Testcases and examples are included in `vittest.cc`. A Makefile and Eclipse project
is provided as well.
